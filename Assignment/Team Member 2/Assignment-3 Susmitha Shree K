"""** Split this string:**

    s = "Hi there Sam!"
    
**into a list. **
"""

s = "Hi there Sam!"

print(s.split())

"""** Given the variables:**

    planet = "Earth"
    diameter = 12742

** Use .format() to print the following string: **

    The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.
"""

planet = "Earth"

"""** Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello" **"""

lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]

"""** Given this nest dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky **"""

"""** What is the main difference between a tuple and a list? **"""

#One of the most important differences between a list and a tuple is that list is mutable, whereas a tuple is immutable.

"""** Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form: **

    user@domain.com
    
**So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com**
"""

"""** Create a function that counts the number of times the word "dog" occurs in a string. Again ignore edge cases. **"""

def cntDog(str):
  count=0
  for word in str.lower().split():
    if word=='dog':
      count+=1

"""### Problem
**You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function
  to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". 
  If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 
  and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big    Ticket". Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) -- on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all 
  cases. **
